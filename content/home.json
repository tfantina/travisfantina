It's still under active development and will be launching in formal beta mode this summer!\n\nI wanted to create something that everything I saw lacking in traditional social media and hopefully recapture some of the promise that I felt when I started using FaceBook and Twitter back in the mid 2000s.\n\n##### Ciao is:\n\n* Ad free\n* Privacy focused\n* Segmented by audiences: you get to share what you want with who you want\n* For families and friends \n\n##### Built with:\n\n* Ruby on Rails \n* PostgreSQL \n* Bootstrap \n* HOT Wire",
