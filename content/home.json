  "aboutBody": "Yo. My name is Travis Fantina, I'm a fullstack developer from Earth. Currently living in \nOntario. I'm currently under contact fulltime with an agency called Objective in Salt Lake City, \nwhere I do client work big and small. Everything from single page marketing sites \nmade with NextJS to massive B2B ecommerce platforms built with Elixir. I am not accepting \nnew client work but you should shoot me an email anyway, I'm always interested in \nevening projects, side hustles and in general biting off more than I can chew.\n\nI work primarily with Elixir and the Phoenix framework, I love Ruby and Rails. JavaScript?\nSure I dabble, I'm a huge fan of NextJS, TINA CMS and Vercel deployments. \nOh my job also keeps me well supplied with Craft CMS projects. I do minimal maintaince on \na few WordPress sites and I am not looking to get back into it. So shoot me an email, \ntell me about yourself but don't offer me a job as a senior Python dev."
